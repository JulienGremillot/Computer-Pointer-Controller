This project use the [Gaze Estimation model](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_models_intel_gaze_estimation_adas_0002_description_gaze_estimation_adas_0002.html) to estimate the gaze of the user's eyes and change the mouse pointer position accordingly.

It runs multiple models in the same machine and coordinate the flow of data between those models.
